SIA
	In the Fall of 2018, I joined Southern Investment Association (SIA), which is a Georgia Southern University student managed investment fund group, as a Consumer Discretionary and Risk Management analyst. As the risk analyst, I have applied many tools and techniques used by finance professionals daily to evaluate my group’s portfolio. Some of my data projects for my SIA organization includes: finding rate of return and risk of our stock portfolio, find the correlation between stocks and using Monte Carlo and binomial methods for options pricing.   Although, I did most of my financial analyses independently, I have gone on to teach several of these Python tools and techniques to my group members during meetings, as many SIA members have never used Python. These data projects have contributed to SIA’s goal of creating and actively managing a successful value-based fund. Currently, SIA’s stock performance beats the S&P 500 by 15%.
